      <h2>Downtown</h2>
      <p>Wander around downtown for the day and you'll find yourself surrounded by Winnipeg’s famed architecture, a mix of turn of the 19th century and early 20th century masonry (or, as we like to say, stone skyscrapers) and modern glass buildings. You’ll also be introduced to downtown’s culinary scene, where gourmet sandwiches, food trucks, and handcrafted cocktails are aplenty.</p>

      <p>The Forks, Winnipeg’s most visited tourist destination, is also part of downtown. Amongst its sprawling grounds you’ll find the iconic architectural marvel, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, the Children’s Museum, the Manitoba Theatre for Young People and the bustling Forks Market– which contains vendors selling locally-made gifts, food, fine wines, and skate rentals in the winter. The iconic river intersection boasts one of the world’s longest skating trails in the winter, and water taxis and boat tours in the summer.</p>

      <h2>Canadian Museum for Human Rights</h2>
      <p>
        The Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR; French: Musée canadien pour les droits de la personne)
        is a Canadian Crown corporation and national museum located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, adjacent to The Forks.
        The purpose of the museum is to "explore the subject of human rights with a special but not exclusive reference to Canada,
        to enhance the public's understanding of human rights,
        to promote respect for others and to encourage reflection and dialogue."
